I'm a software developr for Denver Public Schools. I've also worked as a Technology Specialist for Colorado State University Pueblo and taught Spanish at San Diego State University.

I co-created [Seamless](https://seamless-cicd.com/) an open-source, low-config CI/CD pipeline for containerized microservices.
