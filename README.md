### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ryan DeJonghe

I'm a full-stack software engineer experienced in Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL and React. I've also worked as a Technology Specialist for Colorado State University Pueblo and taught Spanish at San Diego State University.

Recently, I co-created [Seamless](https://seamless-cicd.com/) an open-source, low-config CI/CD pipeline for containerized microservices.
